# Contributing to Tarbela

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Tarbela.

You can contribute by reporting bugs, requesting features, writing code, and reviewing other people's change proposals.

We have some ground rules:

### Use issues to discuss features and architecture

For new feature ideas, please open an issue first to discuss if this is wanted. Please first have a look if there already is a similar issue, though.

Issues can also be used for bug reports, and usage support questions.

### Pull requests only

**Don't push to the master branch directly** (even if you are repository admin and can do this technically), instead create a feature branch and open a pull request. (If you don't have write access to this repository, fork the repository to your private account, create the feature branch there, and do a pull request from there.) This allows code review by others.
Pull requests should only be merged after approval by at least one reviewer.


### Write tests for new code

If at all possible, extend the test suite to cover the new code (not just by calling it, also testing its functionality).
